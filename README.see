Welcome to SEE.

This is a library that provides an ECMAScript (JavaScript) run-time
environment. Running configure and compiling in the normal way should
provide the library 'libsee.a' and a test application 'see-shell'.

Developer documentation for using the library can be found in USAGE.html.
The 'see-shell' program is a additional example that demonstrates how
the library is intended to be used.

David Leonard, 2003.
