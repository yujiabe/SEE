This file documents the compatibility flags in <see/interpreter.h>
and used by SEE_interpreter_init_compat().

Disabling all flags yields a very ECMA-strict interpreter. Enabling
different flags provides the behaviour listed below.

Flag	Description
-------	-----------

** ECMA-262-3 Appendix B **

262_3B	Date.toGMTString() is defined, and made equivalent to toUTCString()
262_3B	Date.getYear() and Date.setYear() are defined.
262_3B	Global object has escape() and unescape() functions defined.
262_3B	String.substr() is defined

** Miscellaneous extensions **

EXT1	lexical analyser will recognise octal integers (ie integers starting
	with '0') and will throw an error if they contain a non-octal digit.

EXT1	Coercing native values that do not have a [[DefaultValue]] internal
	property will return an object-unique string, instead of throwing
	a type error.

EXT1	the string representation of a bad date will return the string
	"Invalid Date", instead of "NaN"

EXT1	new Date(s) will recognise date strings of the form '1/1/1999 12:30 AM'

EXT1	Function.prototype will not have a 'prototype' property of its own.

EXT1	Function.prototype.toString() applied to built-in functions and
	constructors (which are not function instances) will return a bogus
	do-nothing FunctionDeclaration instead of throwing a type error.

EXT1	The global object has its [[Prototype]] set to Object.prototype,
	effectively making all its properties available to the global scope,
	but having the good side effect of allowing 'toString()' to
	work anywhere.

EXT1	Calling eval() with a 'this' different to the global object runs
	its contents with the scope and variable object set to 'this'
	(instead of inheriting the caller's context).

EXT1	Native objects synthesize a property "__proto__" with the same
	value as the internal [[Prototype]] property (or null). Assignments
	to __proto__ are accepted if they don't cause a cycle.

EXT1	Native functions assign themselves the "arguments" property when
	called, so that the old idiom of using f.arguments will work.

EXT1	The arguments objects have a default value which is a string
	representing the arguments.

EXT1	In regular expressions character classes, treat as literals the chars
	']' placed first, and '-' when placed last.
	ie: /[^]Aa-zB-]/ == /[^\]Aa-zB\-]/.

EXT1	Array.join(undefined) uses "undefined" as a join string instead of ",".
