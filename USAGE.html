<h1>Using the Simple ECMAScript Engine (SEE)</h1>

<p>
by David Leonard, 2003.
</p>

<p>
ECMAScript is a standardized language also known variously as JavaScript, 
JScript, and LiveScript. 
SEE is a library that provides a parser and runtime environment for this 
language.
It conforms to ECMAScript Edition 3, and to JavaScript 1.5, with
some compatibility switches for earlier versions of
JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript.
</p>

<p>
This documentation is intended for developers wishing to incorporate
SEE into their applications. It explains how you can use SEE to:
<ul>
 <li>	  manage multiple, separate ECMAScript runtime environments,
 <li>	  evaluate instances of user-supplied ECMAScript program text, and
 <li>	  expose your application's objects to those programs.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I will use the phrase "host application" to mean your application, or
any application that uses the SEE runtime environment as auxillary to
some primary purpose.
Typical examples of host applications are web browsers and
scripted XML processors.
</p>

<p>
Throughout this documentation, references are made to the C functions and
macros provided by the SEE library. To avoid definitional redundancy and 
to improve precision, the reader is encouraged to examine the SEE header 
files to find the precise definitions and arguments of each function or macro.

<h2 id="req">Requirements</h2>

<p>
SEE is written completely in ANSI C.
Although SEE is essentially self-contained, it does depend on the
host application or developer providing the following:
<ul>
 <li> an IEEE 754 floating point type (most modern compilers have this)
 <li> a garbage-collecting memory allocator (such as the free Boehm gc)
</ul>
</p>

<p>
At install time, SEEE uses GNU configure to determine if these
are available, and also to determine other system-dependent
properties. 
Host applications should <code>#include &lt;see/see.h&gt;</code> to
access all the macros and functions prototypes.
</p>

<p>
(The developer may find they need to edit the header files to make
SEE work for their system. I would be interested in hearing what
changes were needed so that future releases can supply this automatically
for other users.)
</p>

<h2 id="interp">Creating interpreters</h2>

<p>
The first step in running an ECMAScript program with SEE is to create
an <em>interpreter</em> instance. 
First, allocate storage for a 
<code>struct SEE_interpreter</code> and then call
<code>SEE_interpreter_init()</code> to initialise it.
</p>

<p>
A pointer to your initialised <code>SEE_interpreter</code> structure 
is required for almost every function that SEE provides. 
</p>

<p>
SEE supports multiple interpreter instances. For example, in HTML web 
browsers, each window needs its own interpreter instance as the variables
and bindings to built-in objects can be different and separate in each one.
</p>

<p>
SEE does not support the sharing of object instances across interpreter
instances. SEE's functions are not thread-safe, but if the memory allocator 
is thread-safe then separate threads can use separate interpreters 
without conflict: SEE treats its static storage as read-only.
</p>

<p>
There is no mechanism for explicitly deallocating an initialised
interpreter; instead, SEE expects the garbage collector to reclaim all
unreferenced storage.
</p>

<p>
If SEE encounters an internal error (such as memory exhaustion,
memory corruption, or a bug), it calls the function pointer
<code>SEE_abort</code>, 
passing it a pointer to the interpreter in context. The <code>SEE_abort</code>
global variable initially points to a function that simply calls 
the C library function <code>abort()</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="mem">Memory management</h2>

<p>
It is strongly recommended that the host application use the same memory 
management as SEE. SEE provides 'hook' function pointers that the host 
application can initialise for this purpose. These pointers must be set up 
before any interpreter instances are created.
</p>

<p>
SEE manages memory by calling the following function pointers:
</p>

<pre>
 void* (*SEE_mem_malloc_hook)(struct SEE_interpreter *, unsigned int);
 void  (*SEE_mem_free_hook)(struct SEE_interpreter *, void *);
 void  (*SEE_mem_exhausted_hook)(struct SEE_interpreter *);
</pre>

<p>
If SEE was compiled with Boehm-gc support, these hooks are initialised to
wrappers around the <code>GC_malloc()</code> and 
<code>GC_free()</code> functions. 
Otherwise, the application must initialise them.
(If you intend to implement these, be aware that they may be called
with a NULL argument, indicating unknown context.)
</p>

<p>
If SEE detects a memory allocation function returning NULL, it will call the
function pointer <code>SEE_mem_exhausted_hook</code>, which defaults 
to a function that calls <code>SEE_abort</code>.
</p>

<p>
Currently, SEE never uses <code>SEE_mem_free_hook</code>,
although future versions may use it.
It may be safely left at its default value, NULL.
</p>

<p>
SEE provides three convenient macros for allocating storage. They are:
<ul>
<li><code>SEE_NEW(interp, type)</code> 
	- allocate structure storage returning a pointer of type 
		<code>type *</code>
<li><code>SEE_NEW_ARRAY(interp, type, length)</code>
	- allocate array storage returning a pointer of type 
		<code>type *</code>
<li><code>SEE_ALLOCA(length, type)</code>
	- allocate an array of element storage on the stack returning a 
	  pointer of type <code>type *</code>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="mem2">On memory allocators</h3>

<p>
Memory allocators can be controversial; as a developer you will understand
your applications's memory requirments and limitations better than anyone.
Developers not familiar with garbage collectors are often concerned that
using them in their application will result in something somehow substandard.
This section tries to address that concern.
</p>

<p>
SEE was designed for use with a garbage
collector, partly because the ECMAScript language specification implies it,
but mainly because using an alternative
(strict) memory allocator would overly penalize the
development time, run-time performance and code size of the library
(and consequently of the host application). A range of very good, sometimes
freely available garbage-collecting allocators exist for the C language
on wide range of platforms. Arguments can be made that garbage collecting
allocators have much improved runtime performance and overhead than any 
scheme that manage storage explicitly.
</p>

<p>
That said, it would be a straightforward (albeit tedious) exercise to 
convert most of SEE to use (say) a reference-counting memory allocator: all 
functions would need to handle exceptions, so as to explicitly deallocate 
acquired references and dispose of temporary values on the stack; the 
<code>SEE_string</code> management code would need to carefully track 
segment sharing; and careful management would be required to handle
the unavoidable reference cycles involving object constructors and their
prototype objects, as well as cycles occuring in recursive function scope 
chains. This is not trivial. Using a garbage collecting allocator is heaps
easier!
</p>

<h2 id="eval">Running programs</h2>

<p>
The general strategy for invoking ECMAScript program text is as follows:
<ol>
 <li> obtain an initialised <code>SEE_interpreter</code> structure;
 <li> construct a <code>SEE_input</code> stream that can transport the 
      ECMAScript program text to SEE;
 <li> establish a try-catch context;
 <li> call the function <code>SEE_Global_eval()</code> to parse and
      evaluate the stream;
 <li> handle any exceptions caught in the try-catch context;
 <li> optionally examine the value result returned
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The <code>SEE_Global_eval()</code> function is optionally able to
return the value associated with the last statement executed. 
In a non-interactive environment, this value is meaningless, and the
value result return pointer given to <code>SEE_Global_eval()</code> may be 
safely given as NULL.
</p>

<h3 id="input">Inputs</h3>

<p>
SEE uses 'inputs' as character stream sources to scan and parse ECMAScript 
program text. Because ECMAScript is defined to use Unicode, the inputs
must provide a stream of <code>SEE_unicode_t</code> (UCS-4) characters.
(If you don't care about Unicode, it is helpful to know that 7-bit ascii 
is a direct subset of Unicode. SEE uses Unicode internally).
</p>

<p>
SEE uses this generalised stream input API rather than (say) a 
simple UCS-4 or UTF-8 string API, because Unicode-compliant applications will 
usually have a much better understanding of the encodings they are using 
than will SEE and streams provide this flexibility, and also because 
streams avoids much unnecessary duplication in terms of text storage.
</p>

<p>
Inputs are described with <code>struct SEE_input</code> structures. 
These functionally resemble stdio's <code>FILE</code> type, or Java's 
<code>ByteReader</code> classes, but stream fully-decoded Unicode characters
instead. Each <code>SEE_input</code> structure contains
the input's state and provides a pointer to its access methods.
</p>

<p>
The <code>inputclass</code> member
indicates the access methods.
It is a pointer to a <code>SEE_inputclass</code> structure. This class structure
contains function pointers to the two methods <code>next()</code> and 
<code>close()</code>.
</p>

<p>Use these convenience macros to call the input methods:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Macro</th>
    <th>Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><code>SEE_INPUT_NEXT()</code></td>
    <td>consume and return the next Unicode character from the stream</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>SEE_INPUT_CLOSE()</code></td>
    <td>release any resources obtained by the stream</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>
The <code>next()</code> method should advance the input pointer, update the
<code>eof</code> and <code>lookahead</code> members of the 
<code>SEE_input</code> structure, and return the old value of 
<code>lookahead</code>. 
SEE's scanner calls <code>next()</code> repeatedly, until
the <code>eof</code> member becomes true.
</p>

<p>
If the <code>next()</code> method encounters an encoding error, it should 
return <code>SEE_INPUT_BADCHAR</code> and try to recover. 
It can throw an exception if it wants to, but SEE does not attempt to 
handle that: the application or user program will receive it.
</p>

<p>
The <code>close()</code> method should deallocate any operating system
resources acquired during the input stream's construction. Note that,
by convention, SEE will not call the <code>close()</code> method 
of any application-supplied input. The onus is on the caller to close the
inputs supplies to SEE library functions.
</p>

<p>
The <code>SEE_input</code> structure maintains the input state in various 
members.
Most importantly, the <code>lookahead</code> field must always reflect the
next character that a call to <code>next()</code> would return.
Once set, the <code>filename</code>, <code>first_lineno</code> and 
<code>interpreter</code> members of the <code>SEE_input</code> structure 
should not be changed. 
The <code>lookahead</code> and <code>eof</code> members 
should also be initialised before the structure is given to SEE.
</p>

<p>
Three demonstration/testing input constructors are provided. When called,
they create a new <code>SEE_input</code> structure, appropriately initialised.
They are:
<ul>
  <li>	<code>SEE_input_file()</code>
	- reads from a stdio <code>FILE</code> pointer; understands BOMs
  <li>	<code>SEE_input_utf8()</code>
	- reads from a null-terminated <code>char</code> array; assumes ASCII/UTF-8 encoding
  <li>	<code>SEE_input_string()</code>
	- reads from a <code>SEE_string</code>; assumes UTF-16 encoding
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Application developers are strongly encouraged to develop their own input
constructors suitable for their own application, based on these examples.
</p>


<h3 id="try">Try-catch contexts</h3>

<p>
SEE's exceptions are implemented using C's 
<code>setjmp()</code>/<code>longjmp()</code> mechanism. SEE provides macros 
that establish a try-catch context, and to test if a try block 
terminated abnormally (i.e. due to an exception). Typical code that
uses try-catch looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
	struct SEE_interpreter *interp;
	struct SEE_value *e;
	<b>SEE_try_context_t</b> c; /* <i>storage for the try-catch context</i> */

	...

	<b>SEE_TRY</b>(interp, c) {

		/*
		 * <i>Now inside a protected "try block".</i>
		 * <i>The following calls may throw exceptions if they want,</i>
		 * <i>causing the try block to exit immediately.</i>
		 */
		do_something();
		do_something_else();

		/* 
		 * <i>Because the SEE_TRY macro expands into a 'for' loop,</i>
		 * <i>avoid using 'break', or 'return' statements.</i>
		 * <i>If you must leave the try block, use 'continue;',</i>
		 * <i>or throw an exception.</i>
		 */
	}

	/* <i>Code placed here always runs.</i> */
	do_cleanup();

	if ((e = <b>SEE_CAUGHT</b>(c))) {
		/* <i>Handle the thrown exception 'e', somehow.</i> */
		handle_exception(e);

		/* <i>or you can throw it up to the next handler like so:</i> */
		<b>SEE_THROW</b>(interp, e);
	}

	...
</pre>

<p>
Do <strong>not</strong> <code>return</code>, <code>goto</code> or 
<code>break</code> out of a try block; the macro does not check for this, 
and the try-catch context may not be restored properly, causing all sorts of
havoc.
</p>

<p>
Exceptions thrown outside of any try-catch context will cause the
interpreter to abort.
</p>

<p>
If you are not interested in catching exceptions, and only want the
'finally' behaviour, use the following idiom:
</p>

<pre>
	<b>SEE_TRY</b>(interp, c) {
		do_something();
	}
	do_cleanup();
	<b>SEE_DEFAULT_CATCH</b>(interp, c);
</pre>

<h2 id="value">Values</h2>

<p>
Eventually, the host application will need to pass numbers, strings and 
complex objects about through the SEE interpreter to and from the user code.
The ECMAScript language provides for only six value types. They are:
<ul>
 <li><em>undefined</em>	- with exactly one value: <code class=js>undefined</code>
 <li><em>null</em>	- with exactly one value: <code class=js>null</code>
 <li><em>boolean</em>	- with exactly two values: <code class=js>true</code>
			  and <code>false</code>
 <li><em>number</em>	- IEEE 754 64-bit floating point numbers
 <li><em>string</em>	- UTF-16 character arrays
 <li><em>object</em>	- a reference to a bag of named properties
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The <code>struct SEE_value</code> structure type expresses all these values
(and some more that are the parser uses):
</p>

<pre>
	struct SEE_value {
	    enum { ... } 	    type;
	    union {
		SEE_boolean_t	    boolean;
		SEE_number_t	    number;
		struct SEE_string * string;
		struct SEE_object * object;
		...
	    } u;
	};
</pre>

<p>
Its <code>type</code> member acts as a discriminator, and is always one of 
<code>SEE_UNDEFINED</code>, <code>SEE_NULL</code>, 
<code>SEE_BOOLEAN</code>, <code>SEE_NUMBER</code>, <code>SEE_STRING</code> or
<code>SEE_OBJECT</code>.
</p>

<p>
Given a <code>struct SEE_value</code> called <code>v</code>, 
you can access the appropriate member of the union <code>v.u</code> as 
shown in the following table:
</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>	<th><code>v.type</code></th>
	<th>Valid member</th>
	<th>Member's type</th>	</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>	<td><code>SEE_UNDEFINED</code></td>
	<td>n/a</td>					</tr>
<tr>	<td><code>SEE_NULL</code></td>
	<td>n/a</td>					</tr>
<tr>	<td><code>SEE_BOOLEAN</code></td>
	<td><code>v.u.boolean</code></td>
	<td><code>SEE_boolean_t</code></td>		</tr>
<tr>	<td><code>SEE_NUMBER</code></td>
	<td><code>v.u.number</code></td>
	<td><code>SEE_number_t</code></td>		</tr>
<tr>	<td><code>SEE_STRING</code></td>
	<td><code>v.u.string</code></td>
	<td><code>struct SEE_string *</code></td>	</tr>
<tr>	<td><code>SEE_OBJECT</code></td>
	<td><code>v.u.object</code></td>
	<td><code>struct SEE_object *</code></td>	</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Two other types (<code>SEE_COMPLETION</code> and <code>SEE_REFERENCE</code>)
are only used internally to SEE and are not documented here.
</p>

<p>
To initialise <code>struct SEE_value</code> structures, 
use the macros provided. These set the <code>type</code> field and the 
appropriate part of the union.
</p>

<pre>
	void SEE_SET_UNDEFINED(struct SEE_value *)
	void SEE_SET_NULL(struct SEE_value *)
	void SEE_SET_OBJECT(struct SEE_value *, struct SEE_object *)
	void SEE_SET_STRING(struct SEE_value *, struct SEE_string *)
	void SEE_SET_NUMBER(struct SEE_value *, SEE_number_t)
	void SEE_SET_BOOLEAN(struct SEE_value *, SEE_boolean_t)
</pre>

<p>
To copy a value, use the following macro:
</p>

<pre>
	void SEE_VALUE_COPY(struct SEE_value *dst, struct SEE_value *src)
</pre>

<p>
Most <code>SEE_value</code>s are passed about the SEE library functions using 
pointers.
In particular, functions that need to return a value do so by copying
the value into the <code>struct SEE_value</code> that the caller provides.
Conventionally, the result value pointer is the last argument to these
functions. The <code>SEE_VALUE_COPY()</code> macro breaks this convention
by instead following the better-known idiom of <code>memcpy()</code>.
</p>

<p>
The ECMAScript language specification provides for conversion functions
that the host application developer may find useful. They convert values
into values of a known type:

<ul>
<li><code>SEE_ToPrimitive()</code>
    - Returns a non-object value. It calls the
	object's <code>DefaultValue()</code> method
<li><code>SEE_ToBoolean()</code>
    - Returns a value of type <code>SEE_BOOLEAN</code>
<li><code>SEE_ToNumber()</code>
    - Returns a value of type <code>SEE_NUMBER</code>
<li><code>SEE_ToInteger()</code>
    - Returns a value of type <code>SEE_NUMBER</code>
	that is also a finite integer
<li><code>SEE_ToString()</code>
    - Returns a value of type <code>SEE_STRING</code>
<li><code>SEE_ToObject()</code>
    - Returns a value of type <code>SEE_OBJECT</code>
	using the <code class=js>String</code>, 
	<code class=js>Number</code> and
	<code class=js>Boolean</code>
	constructors
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="undef">Undefined, null, boolean and number values</h3>

<p>
The undefined and null types have only one implicit and default value.
</p>

<p>
Boolean types (<code>SEE_boolean_t</code>) have values of either true (non-zero) or false (zero). 
</p>

<p>
Number values (<code>SEE_number_t</code>) are IEEE 754 signed floating 
point numbers, normally corresponding to the C compiler's built-in
<code>double</code> type.
</p>

<p>
The following macros may be used to find information about a number value.
(They assume that the <code>type</code> is <code>SEE_NUMBER</code>):
<ul>
  <li>	<code>SEE_NUMBER_ISNAN()</code>  - return true if the number is 
					   not finite or real
  <li>	<code>SEE_NUMBER_ISPINF()</code> - return true if number is +&infin;
  <li>	<code>SEE_NUMBER_ISNINF()</code> - return true if number is -&infin;
  <li>	<code>SEE_NUMBER_ISINF()</code>  - return true if number is 
					   &plusmn;&infin;
  <li>	<code>SEE_NUMBER_ISFINITE()</code> - number is not one of the above
</ul>
</p>

<p>
SEE also provides constants <code>SEE_Infinity</code> and <code>SEE_NaN</code>
which may be stored in number values, but should not be used to compare
number values. Use the macros mentioned previously, instead.
</p>

<p>
Numbers (and other values) may be converted to integers using the functions
<code>SEE_ToInt32()</code>, <code>SEE_ToUint32()</code> or 
<code>SEE_ToUint16()</code>. SEE provides three data types
for integers:
<ul>
  <li> <code>SEE_uint16_t</code>	- 16 bit unsigned integer
  <li> <code>SEE_uint32_t</code>	- 32 bit unsigned integer
  <li> <code>SEE_int32_t</code>		- 32 bit signed integer
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="string">String values</h3>

<p>
String values are pointers to SEE_string structures, that hold UTF-16 strings.
Assuming a <code>struct SEE_string *</code> called <code>s</code>,
the useful members of this structure are shown in the following table:
</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Member</th>
    <th>Member's type</th>
    <th>Description</th>		</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><code>s->length</code></td>
    <td><code>unsigned int</code></td>
    <td>Length of string in UTF-16 characters</td> </tr>
<tr><td><code>s->data</code></td>
    <td><code>SEE_char_t *</code></td>
    <td>Read-only sring storage</td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Be aware that other strings may come to share the string's data, such
as by forming substrings. 
A string's content must not be modified after construction because of this
risk. However, the <code>length</code>
field of a string may be changed to a <strong>smaller</strong> value
at any time without concern.
</p>

<p>
The <code>SEE_char_t</code> type represents each character in the string.
It is equivalent to a 16-bit unsigned integer.
</p>

<p>
To manipulate a string, first create a new string using one of the following:
<ul>	
  <li><code>SEE_string_new()</code> - create a new, empty string
  <li><code>SEE_string_dup()</code> - create a new string with duplicate content
  <li><code>SEE_string_concat()</code> - create a new string by duplicating 
	two other strings
  <li><code>SEE_string_sprintf()</code> - create a new string using 
	<code>printf</code>-like arguments
  <li><code>SEE_string_vsprintf()</code> - create a new string using
	<code>vprintf</code>-like arguments
</ul>
</p>

<p>
And then, optionally, append characters to your new string using the following:
<ul>
  <li><code>SEE_string_addch()</code> - append a UTF-16 character
  <li><code>SEE_string_append()</code> - append contents of another string
  <li><code>SEE_string_append_int()</code> - append a signed integer's
						representation in base 10
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Once a string has been passed to any other SEE function, it is generally
unwise to modify its contents in any way. It is also OK to share a string
between different interpreters if the string is guaranteed not to be
modified, and the garbage collector can cope with it.
</p>

<p>
All strings are assumed to use UTF-16 encoding, meaning that in some cases
you will need to be aware of Unicode surrogate characters. If the host
application really needs (say) UCS-4 strings, you will need to write your
own conversion functionl. (The <code>SEE_input_string()</code> generator 
may prove useful here).
</p>

<p>
Note: The <code>SEE_string_sprintf()</code> and
<code>SEE_string_vsprintf()</code> functions assume the string
constructed exists wholly within the 7-bit ASCII subset of Unicode.
</p>

<p>
Other string functions provided are:
<ul>
 <li><code>SEE_string_substr()</code> 
	- create a read-only substring string
 <li><code>SEE_string_literal()</code> 	
	- copy the string, quoting and escaping chars
 <li><code>SEE_string_vsprintf()</code>	
	- like sprintf, but takes a va_list
 <li><code>SEE_string_fputs()</code> 	
	- put the string to the stdio file using UTF-8
 <li><code>SEE_string_cmp()</code> 	
	- compares two strings, like <code>strcmp()</code>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you find yourself comparing strings a lot, you may find it easier to
compare <em>internalised</em> strings. 
These are strings that are kept in a fast
hash table and may be compared equal using pointer equality. 
The <code>SEE_intern()</code> function is very fast on alread-interned strings,
so it is worth using over <code>SEE_string_cmp()</code> if the strings 
are likely to be intern'ed already. (Most property names are.)
</p>

<h2 id="object">Objects</h2>

<p>
ECMAScript uses a prototype-inheritance object model with simple named
properties. More information on the object model can be found in the 
ECMA-262 standard, and in other JavaScript references.
</p>

<p>
Objects are implemented as in-memory structures, with an 
<code>objectclass</code> pointer to a table of operational methods.
</p>

<p>
This section first describes how all objects can be accessed (the 'client
interface'), and then goes on to describe the API that host applications
can use to make their own objects visible (the 'implementation interface').
</p>


<h3 id="objclient">Object values, and the object client interface</h3>

<p>
All object values are pointers to object instances. The pointers are of type
<code>struct SEE_object *</code>.
No object pointer in an object value should ever point to NULL.
</p>

<p>
Objects can be acessed and manipulated using the following macros:
<ul>
<li><code>SEE_OBJECT_GET()</code>
	- retreive a named property or return undefined
	  ("<code class=js>o.prop</code>")
<li><code>SEE_OBJECT_PUT()</code>
	- create/update a named property
	  ("<code class=js>o.prop = val</code>")
<li><code>SEE_OBJECT_CANPUT()</code>
	- returns true if the property can be changed
<li><code>SEE_OBJECT_HASPROPERTY()</code>
	- tests for existence of a property
<li><code>SEE_OBJECT_DELETE()</code>
	- delete a property; returns true on success 
	  ("<code class=js>delete o.prop</code>")
<li><code>SEE_OBJECT_DEFAULTVALUE()</code>
	- returns the string or number value associated with the object
<li><code>SEE_OBJECT_CONSTRUCT()</code>
	- call object as a constructor ("<code class=js>new o(</code>...<code class=js>)</code>")
<li><code>SEE_OBJECT_CALL()</code>
	- call object as a function ("<code class=js>o(</code>...<code class=js>)</code>")
<li><code>SEE_OBJECT_HASINSTANCE()</code>
	- return true if the objects are related
	  ("<code class=js>x instanceof o</code>")
<li><code>SEE_OBJECT_ENUMERATOR()</code>
	- create a property enumerator ("<code class=js>for (i in o)</code> ...")
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Note that the last four macros <string>do not check</string> if the object 
has a NULL pointer for the corresponding object method. Calling them on an
unchecked object will probably result in an access violation (segmentation
fault). The following macros return true if the object safely provides 
those methods:
<ul>
 <li><code>SEE_OBJECT_HAS_CALL()</code>
 <li><code>SEE_OBJECT_HAS_CONSTRUCT()</code>
 <li><code>SEE_OBJECT_HAS_HASINSTANCE()</code>
 <li><code>SEE_OBJECT_HAS_ENUMERATOR()</code>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
When storing properties in an object with <code>SEE_OBJECT_PUT()</code>, 
a <code>flags</code> parameter is required. 
Normally, this should be supplied as zero, but when constructing
an object with properties for the first time, the following bit
flags can be used:
</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Flag</th>
    <th>Meaning</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><code>SEE_ATTR_READONLY</code></td>
    <td>Future puts on this property will fail</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>SEE_ATTR_DONTENUM</code></td>
    <td>Enumerators will not list this property<br>
	(and will hide prototype properties of<br>
	the same name)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>SEE_ATTR_DONTDELETE</code></td>
    <td>Future deletes on this property will fail</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
A property enumerator is a pointer to a <code>struct SEE_enum</code>,
that allows sequential access to the (enumerable) properties of the object. 
The order of the enumeration is not guaranteed to be sorted, or even to 
be the same each time. Once a pointer to a <code>struct SEE_enum</code>
is obtained, the following macros can be used to allow access it:
<ul>
 <li><code>SEE_ENUM_NEXT()</code>
	- return a pointer to a property name, or NULL 
          when the properties have been exhausted.
 <li><code>SEE_ENUM_RESET()</code>
	- rewind the enumerator to the start again
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Enumerators will become unstable if the properties of the underlying
object change during enumeration. The recommended strategy is to create your
own private list of property names and discard the enumerator before 
attempting to modify the object.
</p>


<h3 id="objimpl">The object implementation interface</h3>

<p>
A host application usually wishes to expose its own objects to the
runtime environment. SEE uses an object implementation API that
host objects can independently provide.
</p>

<p>
All SEE objects are in-memory structures starting with a 
<code>struct SEE_object</code>:
<pre>	
	struct SEE_object {
		struct SEE_objectclass *objectclass;
		struct SEE_object *     Prototype;
	};
</pre>

<p>
Normally, this is just part of a larger structure that maintains the object
state. For example, <code class=js>Number</code> objects could be defined as:
</p>

<pre>
	struct number_object {
		struct SEE_object object;
		SEE_number_t      number;
	};
</pre>

<p>
and pointers to a <code>struct number_object</code> can be cast to 
<code>struct SEE_object *</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>objectclass</code> field of a <code>struct SEE_object</code> 
points to a <code>struct SEE_objectclass</code>:
</p>

<pre>
	struct SEE_objectclass {
		struct SEE_string *     Class;		/* mandatory */
		SEE_get_fn_t            Get;		/* mandatory */
		SEE_put_fn_t            Put;		/* mandatory */
		SEE_boolean_fn_t        CanPut;		/* mandatory */
		SEE_boolean_fn_t        HasProperty;	/* mandatory */
		SEE_boolean_fn_t        Delete;		/* mandatory */
		SEE_default_fn_t        DefaultValue;	/* mandatory */
		SEE_enumerator_fn_t     enumerator;	/* optional */
		SEE_call_fn_t           Construct;	/* optional */
		SEE_call_fn_t           Call;		/* optional */
		SEE_hasinstance_fn_t    HasInstance;	/* optional */
	};
</pre>

<p>
The members of this structure are function pointers.
Use the various <code>SEE_OBJECT_*</code> convenience macros to call them.
A member marked "optional" may be set to NULL, in which case
a sensible default action is taken.
</p>

<p>
The host application typically constructs one instance of a 
<code>SEE_objectclass</code>, and provides implementations for the 
mandatory object methods <code>Get</code>, <code>Put</code>, etc.
SEE expects a precise behaviour from these methods.
The behaviours are fully described in the 
ECMA-262 standard, but can be summarised as follows:
</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Method</th>
    <th>Behaviour</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><code>Get</code></td>
    <td>retreive a named property (or return undefined)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Put</code></td>
    <td>create/update a named property</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Delete</code></td>
    <td>delete a property or return 0</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>HasProperty</code></td>
    <td>returns 0 if the property doesn't exist</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>CanPut</code></td>
    <td>returns 0 if the property cannot be changed</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>DefaultValue</code></td>
    <td>turns the object into a string or number value</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Construct</code></td>
    <td>constructs a new object; as per the
	<code class=js>new</code> keyword</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Call</code></td>
    <td>the object has been called as a function</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>HasInstance</code></td>
    <td>returns 0 if the objects are unrelated</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>enumerator</code></td>
    <td>allow enumeration of the properties (see above)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
It is up to the host application to provide storage for the properties, and
so forth. The simplest strategy is to simply ignore properties calls to
<code>Put</code> and <code>Get</code> that are meaningless.
To this end, if the host object does not want to support some of the mandatory
operations, it can use the corresponding 'do-nothing' function(s) from 
this list:
<ul>
  <li><code>SEE_no_get()</code>
  <li><code>SEE_no_put()</code>
  <li><code>SEE_no_canput()</code>
  <li><code>SEE_no_hasproperty()</code>
  <li><code>SEE_no_delete()</code>
  <li><code>SEE_no_defaultvalue()</code>
  <li><code>SEE_no_enumerator()</code>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The <code>Prototype</code> field can either be set to the interpreter's 
<code>Object_prototype</code>, to NULL, or even to some other object.
</p>

<p>
Once the host application has constructed its own objects that
conform to the API, they can be inserted into the 'Global object'
as object-valued properties.
</p>

<p>
The 'Global object' is a user-inaccessible object whose sole purpose
is to hold all the built-in objects, such as <code class=js>Object</code>,
<code class=js>Function</code>, <code class=js>Math</code>,
etc., as well as all user-declared global variables. The host
application can access it through the <code>Global</code> member of the
<code>SEE_interpreter</code> structure.
</p>


<h3 id="native">Native objects</h3>

<p>
SEE provides support for a special kind of object class called <em>native 
objects</em>. Native objects maintain a hash table of properties, and 
implement the mandatory methods (plus <code>enumerator</code>), and 
correctly observe the <code>Prototype</code> field.
</p>

<pre>
	struct SEE_native {
		struct SEE_object       object;
		struct SEE_property *   properties[SEE_NATIVE_HASHLEN];
	};
</pre>

<p>
An application can create host objects based on native objects.
First, place a <code>struct SEE_native</code> at the beginning of a
structure:
</p>

<pre>
	struct some_host_object {
		struct SEE_native       native;
		int			host_specific_info;
	};
</pre>

<p>
Then, use the following objects methods, either directly in the 
<code>SEE_objectclass</code> structure, or by calling them indirectly 
from method implementations:
<ul>
  <li><code>SEE_native_get()</code>
  <li><code>SEE_native_put()</code>
  <li><code>SEE_native_canput()</code>
  <li><code>SEE_native_hasproperty()</code>
  <li><code>SEE_native_delete()</code>
  <li><code>SEE_native_defaultvalue()</code>
  <li><code>SEE_native_enumerator()</code>
</ul>
</p>


<h3 id="cfunction">C Function objects</h3>

<p>
Often, a host application wishes to provide a callable function to the
runtime environment, backed by a C function. This requires the construction
of an object whose prototype is <code class=js>Function.prototype</code>,
and whose <code>objectclass</code>'s <code>Call</code> method points to the 
appropriate C function.
</p>

<p>
The function <code>SEE_cfunction_make()</code> performs this construction.
It takes a pointer to the C 
function, and an integer indicating a typical number of arguments. 
(The integer becomes the function object's
"<code class=js>length</code>" property.)
</p>

<p>
NOTE: Objects returned by <code>SEE_cfunction_make()</code> should really only 
be used in the interpreter context in which they were created, but the 
current version of SEE does not check for this. (Because cfunction objects 
are essentially read-only after construction, and if memory allocation
operates independently of the interpreters, sharing cfunction objects 
across interpreters will work OK. But, it is not recommended for future
portability.)
</p>

<p>
A typical C function looks like the following: 
(actual code for <code class=js>Math.sqrt</code>)
</p>

<pre>
	static void
	math_sqrt(interp, self, thisobj, argc, argv, res)
		struct SEE_interpreter *interp;
		struct SEE_object *self, *thisobj;
		int argc;
		struct SEE_value **argv, *res;
	{
		struct SEE_value v;

		if (argc == 0)
			SEE_SET_UNDEFINED(res);
		else {
			SEE_ToNumber(interp, argv[0], &v);
			SEE_SET_NUMBER(res, sqrt(v.u.number));
		}
	}
</pre>

<p>
The arguments passed to the C function, from <code>SEE_OBJECT_CALL</code>
are described in the following table:
</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Argument</th>
    <th>Purpose</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><code>interp</code></td>
    <td>the current interpreter context</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>self</code></td>
    <td>a pointer to the object called 
	(<code class=js>Math.sqrt</code> here)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>thisobj</code></td>
    <td>the <code class=js>this</code> object 
	(the <code class=js>Math</code> object in this 
	case)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>argc</code></td>
    <td>number of arguments</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>argv</code></td>
    <td>array of value pointers, of length <code>argc</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>res</code></td>
    <td>value location in which to store the result</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
The C function should ignore any extra arguments, and 
treat unsupplied arguments as if they were undefined values.
It should also check any assumptions made about <code>thisobj</code>,
if it uses it.
</p>


<h3 id="function">User function objects</h3>

<p>
Occasionally, a host application will wish to take some user text and 
create a callable function object from it. One way to do this is
to invoke the <code class=js>Function</code> constructor with 
<code>SEE_OBJECT_CONSTRUCT</code>, passing it the arguments and 
body text as arguments.
</p>

<p>
Another way, that is more convenient if the user text is available as 
an input stream, is to use the <code>SEE_Function_new()</code> function:
</p>

<pre>
	struct SEE_object *SEE_Function_new(struct SEE_interpreter *interp, 
		struct SEE_string *name, struct SEE_input *param_input, 
		struct SEE_input *body_input);
</pre>

<p>
where any of the the <code>name</code>, <code>param_input</code> and
<code>body_input</code> parameters may be NULL (indicating to use the 
empty string).
</p>

<p>
The returned function object may be called with the 
<code>SEE_OBJECT_CALL()</code> macro.
</p>


<h3 id="error">Errors and Error objects</h3>

<p>
Host applications sometimes need to convey errors to ECMAScript programs.
Errors in ECMAScript are typically indicated by throwing an exception
with an object value.  The thrown objects conventionally have 
<code class=js>Error.prototype</code> somewhere in their prototype chain, 
and provide a <code class=js>message</code> and <code class=js>name</code> 
property which the <code class=js>Error.prototype</code> reads to generate
a human-readable error message.
</p>

<p>
Host applications can conveniently construct and throw new errors using 
the following macros:
</p>

<pre>
	SEE_error_throw_string(interp, constructor, string)
	SEE_error_throw(interp, constructor, fmt, ...)
	SEE_error_throw_sys(interp, constructor, fmt, ...)
</pre>

<p>
These macros construct a new error object, and throw it as an exception.
The error object thrown normally has a <code class=js>message</code>
string property that reflects the rest of the arguments provided 
to the macro.
The <code>SEE_error_throw_sys()</code> macro
additionally appends a textual description of <code>errno</code> as well.

<p>
The <code>constructor</code> argyment should be one of the error 
constructor objects found in the <code>SEE_interpreter</code> structure:
</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Member</th>
    <th>Meaning</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><code>Error</code></td>
    <td>runtime error</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>EvalError</code></td>
    <td>error in <code class=js>eval()</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>RangeError</code></td>
    <td>numeric argument has exceeded allowable range</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>ReferenceError</code></td>
    <td>invalid reference was detected</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>SyntaxError</code></td>
    <td>parsing error</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>TypeError</code></td>
    <td>actual type of an operand different to that expected</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>URIError</code></td>
    <td>error in a global URI handling function</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Although <code>Error</code> is usually sufficient for most errors,
host applications can create their own error constructor object with the
<code>SEE_Error_make()</code> convenience function. Only one constructor
of the same name should be created per interpreter.
</p>

<h2 id="debug">Debugging facilities</h2>

<p>
The SEE library contains various debugging facilities, that are
omitted if it is compiled with the <code>NDEBUG</code> preprocessor define.
</p>

<p>
Most useful to the application developer are these two functions:
</p>

<pre>
	void SEE_PrintValue(struct SEE_interpreter *i, 
		struct SEE_value *v, FILE *f);
	void SEE_PrintObject(struct SEE_interpreter *i, 
		struct SEE_object *o, FILE *f);
</pre>

<p>
If debugging the library itself, it is worth reading the source code to
find the debug flag variables that can be turned on by the host 
application to enable verbose traces during execution.
</p>
